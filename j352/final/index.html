                    <p>The University of Maryland is facing a large lack of diversity in its classrooms according to
                        data published by the school.
                    </p>

                    <p>According to the data presented by the Institutional Research, Planning & Assessment team,
                        Maryland’s Philip Merril College of Journalism sees a large lack of people of color in both
                        its student and faculty populations. </p>

                    <p>The published report shows that of the school’s over 400 undergraduate students, only 19.5%
                        are people of color, leaving more than half of the student body population identifying as
                        white. </p>

                    <p>Despite Maryland’s status as a predominantly white institution, the school’s undergraduate
                        class remains relatively diverse, with approximately 58.4% identifying as non-white
                        students.

            <p>This ultimately can impact the lens in which stories about diverse communities are told.
                <br>
                According to a 2008 study conducted by H. Denis WU and Ralph Izard, researchers found
                that
                when more Asian American journalists were present in a news organization, there was an
                increased amount of positive coverage of the Asian American community.

            <p>Chryl Laird, an Associate Professor of Government & Politics at Maryland, notes the power
                of
                diverse newsrooms. </p>

            <p>In her many appearances in media publications, the political scholar shares how diversity
                in
                the newsroom can impact how stories are being told.
            </p>

            <p>In her appearances on <a
                    href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/05/812644981/understanding-the-black-vote-in-the-democratic-primary">NPR’s
                    Code Switch Podcasts</a>, Laird shares how her conversations with Gene Demby, a
                Black
                journalist, assist in advocating for the advocacy and agency of African-Americans</p>


            <p>“You know, there is a way that some punditry style is done, where you know it's about
                that
                quick, give us that soundbite,” Laird says. <br>“I think with my research and the kind
                of
                work that I do on Black political behavior … [Journalists of color] always acknowledge
                and
                appreciate the fact that I centered Black people.”
