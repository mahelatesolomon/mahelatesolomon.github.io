    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>Princess Rosalinda María Montoya Fioré is about to be crowned queen of the small nation of Costa Luna. General
        Magnus Kane, the dictator of neighboring country, Costa Estrella, invades her palace with his agents during her
        coronation rehearsal, and attempts to capture the royal family and take over the country. Major Joe Mason, an
        agent of the Princess Protection Program (P.P.P.), a secret organization funded by royal families that looks
        after endangered princesses, whisks her away to safety via helicopter. Kane's agents, however, succeed in
        capturing her widowed mother, Queen Sofía Fioré of Costa Luna.

        The Princess Protection Program hides Rosalinda in Joe's home in Lake Monroe, Louisiana, where she meets his
        teenage daughter, Carter Mason. Carter is an insecure tomboy who works at the family bait shop and dreams of
        going to the homecoming dance with her crush, Donny, although her classmate, Ed, secretly has a crush on her.
        Rosalinda poses as "Rosie Gonzalez", Carter's cousin from Iowa. Though Carter initially treats her with
        hostility, she warms up to her after Rosie explains her situation, and the two become best friends. Carter
        teaches Rosie to act like the average American teenager, and Rosie shows Carter how to disarm those that scorn
        them, especially resident mean girls, Chelsea Barnes and Brooke Angels. Rosie soon becomes popular at their high
        school.

        In an attempt to trick Rosalinda into exposing her location, General Kane announces plans to forcibly marry her
        mother. Brooke discovers the truth about Rosie and threatens to expose her unless Rosie drops out of the vote
        for Homecoming Queen. Rosie reads of the pending nuptials in the magazine and tells Carter that she has decided
        to return home. Knowing Costa Luna is still too dangerous, Carter secretly devises a plan to pose as Rosalinda
        and use herself as bait to lure Kane into capture. Carter calls Mr. Elegante, Rosalinda's royal dressmaker and
        friend, for help with her plan. He tells Kane that Rosalinda will be attending the homecoming dance and plans to
        wear a Caribbean blue dress that he actually sends it to Carter, and gives Rosie a pale pink one. In the
        meantime,
        Rosie agrees to stay for the dance.

        In order to help make the event special, a group of friends, including Rosie and Carter, wear masks to the
        dance, helping Carter disguise herself as Rosalinda. According to plan, Kane and his agents mistake Carter for
        Rosalinda and lead her to Kane's helicopter. However, after winning the Homecoming Queen title despite Chelsea
        and Brooke's efforts, Rosie discovers and ruins the plan by exposing herself to Kane, insisting to Carter that
        it is not her fight. Luckily, agents of the Princess Protection Program, including Major Mason, have been
        waiting inside the helicopter and rescue both girls. The P.P.P. agents quickly apprehend Kane and his henchmen
        and turn them over to the international authorities. Rosie is crowned Queen Rosalinda of Costa Luna with Carter,
        Joe, Ed, Sofía, and Mr. Elegante in attendance.

        In the extended ending, one year later, Rosie and Carter, who both became P.P.P. agents, are getting ready for
        their new assignment as they board a plane.</p>
